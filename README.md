# Laser-Point-Tracker
The aim of the project is to develop a camera mounted device that will follow a laser pointer. The control of the system should ensure that laser point remains always in the middle of the frame. It will cancel noise(movement, vibrations, etc.) that camera endures hence gives a stable output. By doing so it can also track the movement of the laser pointer to some extent.
